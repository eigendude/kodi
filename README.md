# Welcome to Aclima's Sundström HUD!

A HUD, or heads-up display, is a display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints. Sundström HUD shows sensor and diagnostics data on a display in a way that can be digested quickly and from far away.

## Getting started

Download a build from the [releases](https://github.com/Aclima/sundstrom-hud/releases) page. The HUD can be run standalone or, in the future, attached to an existing Sundström system on the network.
